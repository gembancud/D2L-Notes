# What is this

Personal notes in following through the course material from the book:

- [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/index.html)

# Following Along

**DO NOT SIMPLY BROWSE THROUGH.**
Read through the chapters, and **implement by memory**.
Go through all exercise options and tweak the material to test ideas. Making mistakes is the best way to discover bugs allowing you to debug them yourself.
